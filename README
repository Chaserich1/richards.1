$ bt [-h] [-L -d -g -i -p -s -t -u | -l] [dirname]

To remove all .o and the bt executable:

$ make clean

Additional Project Information:

1. In SearchFileSystem.c I added code to ignore the .git files because they
   were printing lots of additional files and directories when there was no
   directory specified. It works with the .git files but excluding those makes it much
   easier to see that the Breadth-First Traversal is working correctly.
